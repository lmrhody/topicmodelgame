This is a public repository for sharing, improving, and versioning "The Topic Modeling Game," a lesson developed by Lisa Rhody to teach the basics of LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).  You are welcome to fork, branch, and revise the game; however, we ask that you share your experiences and revisions so that others may benefit.
